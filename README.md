# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This project was designed so that a professional Readme would be generated based on user input. The user is prompted with a variety of questions about their own project and then based on their unqiue input a seperate Readme file is automatically generated once the user answers all the questions.

## Example:
<img width="1013" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-18 at 3 47 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72160453/102668112-5dacf980-4148-11eb-9553-9d7d15a25223.png">

The user is asked a series of questions including, project name, describiton, motivation, and more. Once these are all completed with the necessary inforamation they will see that a new file will appear in their folder called "GeneratedREADME.md".
